- 👋 Hi, I’m @TechBreadly
- 👀 I’m interested in beginning my coding journey and learning from my community.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS heading my way to Java with the goal of landing a job.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate quite yet because I do not have enough experience.
- 📫 You can reach me at broke2lessbroke@gmail.com
